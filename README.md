# Machine-Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various machine learning concepts and techniques.  These notebooks cover both fundamental and advanced topics, including ensemble methods, clustering, and neural networks, with a focus on practical applications.

## Contents

The repository includes the following Jupyter Notebooks:

* **[Ensemble methods.ipynb](./Ensemble%20methods.ipynb):** This notebook explores ensemble learning methods, which combine multiple individual models to improve overall performance.  It 
 covers techniques such as:
    * Bagging:  Training multiple models on different subsets of the data and averaging their predictions (e.g., Random Forest).
    * Boosting:  Sequentially training models, where each model tries to correct the errors of the previous ones (e.g., AdaBoost).

* **[Digit Clustering.ipynb](./Digit%20Clustering.ipynb):** This notebook focuses on applying clustering algorithms to the task of digit recognition.  It demonstrates how to:
    * Use unsupervised learning to group similar digit images together.
    * Apply algorithms like K-Means clustering to identify distinct groups within the digit dataset.
    * Visualize the clusters and analyze the characteristics of each group.

* **[Digit recognition using Neural Network.ipynb](./Digit%20recognition%20using%20Neural%20Network.ipynb):** This notebook implements a neural network for the task of digit recognition.  It covers:
    * Building a simple neural network architecture using libraries like TensorFlow or PyTorch.
    * Training the network on a labeled dataset of digit images (e.g., MNIST).
    * Evaluating the performance of the trained network and visualizing the results.
